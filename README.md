Project: Mobile Application on Flutter with Automated Deployment and Monitoring on AWS

Main Steps:

Development of the Mobile Application on Flutter:
Create a simple application, such as for news or notes, that will interact with the backend.
Implement features such as authentication, data upload/display, and comment submission.

Backend:
Create a backend in Python using Flask or FastAPI to handle requests from the mobile application.
Prepare a REST API for data exchange between the mobile application and the backend.

Docker:
Write a Dockerfile for containerizing the backend. This will allow it to run in a container.
Set up Docker Compose if you need to connect a database, such as PostgreSQL.

AWS:
Sign up for AWS and set up the environment:
EC2 for hosting the backend (or use ECS).
S3 for storing static files or images if required.
RDS for the database (or use a local container with the database).
Deploy the Docker container with the backend on EC2 or ECS.

Ansible:
Write Ansible playbooks to automate server setup on EC2:
Install Docker and necessary packages.
Deploy the backend and start containers through Ansible.

CI/CD:
Set up Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions for automated backend deployment:
The pipeline should build Docker images and push them to Docker Hub or ECR.
After a successful push, deploy to EC2 using Ansible.
You can also set up automation for building and publishing the mobile application (e.g., to the Play Store or App Store).

Monitoring and Security:
Use AWS CloudWatch to monitor the status of EC2, API performance, and resource usage.
Set up CloudTrail to track all changes and actions in the infrastructure.
Define IAM policies to manage access to resources.

Automation and Improvements:
Set up automatic scaling (Auto Scaling) in AWS for EC2.
Use Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to distribute the load among instances.
Automate backups for the database on RDS or S3.
